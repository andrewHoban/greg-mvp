- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for SQL generation
- [ ] Add context-aware query refinement
- [ ] Implement query explanation generation
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for generated SQL
- [ ] Create LLM response validation and error handling

## Phase 3: BigQuery Integration (Weeks 7-10)
- [ ] Replace mock executor with real BigQuery client
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and query optimization
- [ ] Add query cost estimation and limits
- [ ] Create result caching with Redis
- [ ] Implement query result pagination
- [ ] Add data freshness tracking and metadata

## Phase 4: Authentication & Security (Weeks 11-13)
- [ ] Implement Okta SSO integration
- [ ] Add JWT token validation middleware
- [ ] Create role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all queries
- [ ] Add API rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 14-17)
- [ ] Document search and knowledge integration
- [ ] PRD generation from query insights
- [ ] Advanced visualization engine with interactive charts
- [ ] Query history and favorites
- [ ] Collaborative query sharing
- [ ] Scheduled query execution and alerts

## Phase 6: Production & Scaling (Weeks 18-20)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- [ ] Error tracking with Sentry integration
- [ ] Performance optimization and load testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Documentation and user onboarding

- Add integration tests with real services
- Implement property-based testing
- Add performance benchmarks
- Create comprehensive API documentation

### Infrastructure Improvements  
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Database connection pooling optimization
- Caching strategy with Redis cluster
- CDN integration for static assets
- Multi-region deployment strategy

## Success Metrics

### Usage Metrics
- **Week 2**: MVP demo to stakeholders
- **Week 6**: 10+ internal users testing LLM queries
- **Week 10**: 50+ queries executed against real data daily
- **Week 13**: 100+ authenticated users across teams
- **Week 17**: 500+ queries daily with advanced features
- **Week 20**: 1000+ queries daily in production

### Quality Metrics
- **Query Accuracy**: >90% of generated SQL executes successfully
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating in user feedback surveys
- **Response Time**: <2s average for query preparation
- **System Uptime**: >99.9% availability in production
- **Error Rate**: <1% of queries result in system errors

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Time Savings**: 50% reduction in ad-hoc query creation time
- **Data Accessibility**: 3x increase in non-technical users querying data
- **Decision Speed**: 25% faster insights generation for product decisions
- **Knowledge Sharing**: 80% of domain knowledge documented in system
- **Adoption Rate**: 75% of product teams using the platform regularly

This roadmap balances rapid MVP delivery with sustainable long-term development, ensuring each phase delivers tangible value while building toward a comprehensive enterprise platform.
