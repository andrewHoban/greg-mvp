caveats:
  - Some reads are estimated when actual meter data is unavailable.
  - Meter replacement events may cause discontinuities in read values.
  - Historical data may have different quality standards.

sample_questions:
  - What is the average read value per month?
  - Which accounts have the highest energy consumption?
  - How many estimated vs actual reads do we have?
  - Show energy consumption trends over the past year.
