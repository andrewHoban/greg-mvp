# PRD Template Placeholder

This directory is intended to contain Jinja2 templates for generating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) based on query results and analysis.

## Future Implementation

When PRD generation is implemented, this directory will contain:

- `base_prd.j2` - Base PRD template with common sections
- `analysis_section.j2` - Template for data analysis sections  
- `visualization_section.j2` - Template for chart and graph sections
- `insights_section.j2` - Template for key insights and recommendations

## Template Structure

Templates will use Jinja2 syntax and support variables such as:

- `{{ query_results }}` - Data from executed queries
- `{{ visualizations }}` - Suggested charts and graphs
- `{{ insights }}` - Generated insights from data analysis
- `{{ metadata }}` - Context about data sources and methodology

## Integration Points

PRD generation will integrate with:

- Query execution results from `/query/execute`
- Visualization suggestions from `/viz/suggest`
- Knowledge base information from `/knowledge/domains`
- Future AI-powered insight generation

This feature is planned for a future release and is not part of the current MVP scope.
