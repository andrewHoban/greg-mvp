# PRD Generation Templates

This directory contains Jinja2 templates for Product Requirements Document (PRD) generation.

## Planned Templates

- `prd_template.md.j2` - Main PRD template with sections for:
  - Executive Summary
  - Problem Statement
  - Proposed Solution
  - Technical Requirements
  - Success Metrics
  - Timeline and Milestones

## Future Implementation

PRD generation endpoints will be implemented in a future version:

- `POST /prd/draft` - Generate PRD draft from query insights
- `POST /prd/export` - Export PRD in various formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

The templates will use data analysis results to automatically populate sections with:
- Data-driven insights
- Suggested technical approaches
- Metrics and KPIs based on available data
- Preliminary timeline estimates

## Usage

Templates will use Jinja2 syntax and will be rendered with context including:
- Query results and analysis
- Domain knowledge
- User inputs and requirements
- Automated insights and recommendations
